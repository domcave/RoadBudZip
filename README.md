# RoadBudZip  
Created by our group during the 2023 Steelhacks Hackathon event. 

## Project
This project is meant to be a prototype of an app that would be the user's car maintenance companion app. The user would first register their car's make and model, and the app would then track how long until the car's next maintenance of things like oil changes, tire rotations, air filter changes, etc. When that certain number of miles has been driven, the app sends an alert.

Ideally, in the future, the app would connect directly to the car to track these things (we used a step counter just to show off functionality). It would also hopefully provide step-by-step help to the user in how to do some of this basic maintenance.

## How to Use

Download the zip file in this repository.    

Then download `Android Studios`.  

Once downloaded, unzip the RoadBud zip file and open it in Android Studios. Then, you can run the emulator from the green `play button` towards the upper right. Or, if you have an Android device, get a compatible cable to connect it to the computer. You can then run the app directly from your phone.
